I think LLMs should be trained on DSL(Domain Specific Language) instead of java/python.
The disadvantage of training on java and python are 
1. Continuous training as Java and Python libraries are upgraded.
2. very difficult to verify the generated code.

DSLs are much easy to verify by both human and LLM since their structures are usually simple.

I am planning to create an XML based language to describe entities, business rules, business logic and workflows.
