# ai-enterprise-thoughts
Thoughts about how AI can be used in the enterprise.
I always was facinated by how we can make abstract ideas or simple change in requirements to reality in quickest, safest way possible.

I like to create softwares which are easy to integrate and query on the logic implemented.
e.g how many times database is hit for saving a customer data? how many REST services are called for deleting a customer?
Can an unauthorised person delete a customer record?
