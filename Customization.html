Customize software products using AI.
Customization effort are usually very expensive during implementation of new requirements and during upgrade of the products.
During upgradation of the product, we need to make sure the old customization are still meaningful and need to be migrated.

I want the customization to be done using AI prompts, thus reducing implementation effort.
For this to work AI should be aware of the repo, business process, business validations and database entities.

Types of customization:
<ul>
  <li>Add a column to an entity</li>
  <li>Delete a column from an entity</li>
  <li>Add a new entity</li>
  <li>Delete an existing entity</li>
  <li>Change business process</li>
  <li>Add a new validation</li>
  <li>Modify a validation</li>
</ul>
